Very helpful talks in one is considering to go for academia,
specially when I am nearly to the submission of my PhD thesis.
With that in mind in considering my human limitations, I written 
down some of the highlights from each of the speakers!

* Hanna Price
	* "It is up to us where to set the boundaries"
	* "Document your advances in science to show your potential"
	* "Learn to turn challenges into opportunities"
	* how fundable is your research?

* Janice Thompson
	* `NO` is a complete sentence.
	* Take risk
	* Learn how to negotiate

* Liz Ballou
	* Keep writing and applying for grants and fellowships,	"what the hell, it is just a funny experience!"
	* As you applying to grants and being rejected, you are refining your ideas.
	* Check out previous REFs  (Research Excellence Framework) http://www.ref.ac.uk/ and look for areas where you can contribute with your skills. 

* Alessandro Mottura
	* When applying for grants, have a clearer plan and give well detailed information of your project
	* be coherent in your trajectory!
	* Hiring a fellowship is about selecting those whose trajectory will shine!
	* One path might be doing research that is driven by industry.
