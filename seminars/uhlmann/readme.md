A GUIDED TOUR OF SPLINE-BASED ACTIVE CONTOURS
 http://talks.bham.ac.uk/talk/index/3574
 Dr Virginie Uhlmann (Research Group Leader, European Bioinformatics Institute, European Molecular Biology Laboratory)
 Monday 25 February 2019, 11:00 - 12:00 Computer Science, The Sloman Lounge (UG)
Host: Dr Iain Styles

Abstract: While image acquisition turns the real, analog world into a collection of pixels, spline interpolation offers a way to go back from the digital to the continuous realm. In particular, splines can be used to define continuous models of deformable curves. Assigned with an appropriately-designed cost function relying on pixel-based information, spline curves evolve in the image from an initial position to fit the contour of objects of interest. Such spline-based active contours simultaneously provide a convenient and flexible tool to obtain precise outlines in a semi-automated way, and a particularly well-suited mathematical model for extracting precise quantitative information that characterize these outlines. In this talk, I will describe in more details the general construction of spline-based active contours and illustrate their use in a collection of 2- and 3-D bioimage analysis problems.
